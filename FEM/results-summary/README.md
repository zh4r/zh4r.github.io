## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JSON

### What I learned

- Keyframe animations
- How to transition a gradient (button hover effect)
- Still getting the hang of `position` & `display`. Those two feel like behemoths in CSS. You get them down - you're good.

### Continued development

I want to:
- Dive deeper into `position` & `display`.
- Understand JSON better.
