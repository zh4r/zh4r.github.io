## My process
This challenge, I wanted to focus on accessability and SEO practices, as I am not very familiar with either, and I would love some feedback on how well I did on both. 

Decided to change the accent color to a warmer one, because I like it better.

Added subtle shadows and animations to give it more character! 

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned
- I familiarized myself with aria labels and meta tags.

- Learned about the `:focus` selector.

- *Somewhere along the way, I got side-tracked into changing emmet defaults, which spiraled into a few hours of emmet rabbit hole exploration.*

### Continued development

I want to continue teaching myself good SEO practices and make my pages as accessible as possible!
