## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

- The correlation between `padding` and `border-radius` was an interesting read.
- A lot about lists behaviour.

### Continued development

- I would love to streamline my process in some way, because this challenge took me way to much time.
- I couldn't understand why the `1` in the `<ol>` decided to be a different font than the other `Outfit` font `1`s...
