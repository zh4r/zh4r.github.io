## My process
Decided to use as little as possible to achieve the needed result. Still learning, so there's probably a lot I could've done differently to make the solution even simpler. Still happy with it, though.

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

How to center a `<div>` :)
